Pymaceuticals, Inc.is a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

For this project I have analysed the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

# 1 - Preparing the data 

I created a clean DataFrame to display only the unique mice IDs, removing any mouse ID with duplicate time points.

# 2 - Generating Summary Statistics

I created a summary statistics table of mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each regimen

# OBSERVATIONS

- Capomulin and Ramicane are significantly better than placebo. 

- Capomulin seems to progressively lower tumour volume over time.

- Tumour size is positively correlated with mouse weight; the larger the mouse, the larger the tumours they get.
